Laura's Happy Adventures Alternative Installer
===========================================

An alternate installer for _Laura's Happy Adventures_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer.

Adapted from [Hype - The Time Quest Alternate Installer](https://github.com/SuiMachine/Hype-The-Time-Quest-Installer) by [SuiMachine](https://github.com/SuiMachine).

This project uses code from both [bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [_Grim Fandango Setup_](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
and [Triangle717's](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com) LEGO Racers installer.
